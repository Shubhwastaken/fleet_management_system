cd ..

## Step 5: Run the Application

## Troubleshooting

### "node is not recognized"
- Install Node.js and restart computer

### "Cannot connect to database"
- Check MySQL is running
- Verify .env credentials
- Run complete_setup.sql

### "Port already in use"
- Close other apps using the port
- Or change PORT in .env file

### Data not showing
- Make sure backend is running first
- Check console for errors (F12 in browser)
- Verify database has data: SELECT * FROM aircraft;

## What You Should See

✅ Dashboard with statistics (10 aircraft, flights, etc.)
✅ Fleet tab showing all 10 aircraft from database
✅ Tracking tab with real-time data
✅ Maintenance records from database
